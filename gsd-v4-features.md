- **v7**: Add `focusSessions`, `taskTemplates`, `goals`, `projects` tables
- **v8**: Future expansions (collaboration, advanced features)

### Migration Strategy
```typescript
// lib/db.ts - v7 migration
this.version(7)
  .stores({
    tasks: "id, quadrant, completed, dueDate, recurrence, *tags, createdAt, updatedAt, [quadrant+completed], notificationSent, *dependencies, scheduledStart, projectId, goalId",
    smartViews: "id, name, isBuiltIn, createdAt",
    notificationSettings: "id",
    focusSessions: "id, taskId, startTime, endTime, sessionType",
    taskTemplates: "id, name, category, isSystemTemplate, usageCount",
    goals: "id, quarter, status, targetDate",
    projects: "id, archived, createdAt"
  })
  .upgrade((trans) => {
    return trans.table("tasks").toCollection().modify((task: TaskRecord) => {
      if (task.estimatedMinutes === undefined) {
        task.estimatedMinutes = undefined;
      }
      if (task.scheduledStart === undefined) {
        task.scheduledStart = undefined;
      }
      if (task.scheduledEnd === undefined) {
        task.scheduledEnd = undefined;
      }
      if (task.projectId === undefined) {
        task.projectId = undefined;
      }
      if (task.goalId === undefined) {
        task.goalId = undefined;
      }
      if (task.isHabit === undefined) {
        task.isHabit = false;
      }
    });
  });
```

### Performance Impact
- **Focus Sessions**: Minimal (local timer)
- **Calendar View**: Medium (needs efficient date indexing)
- **Natural Language**: Low (client-side parsing)
- **Goals/Projects**: Low (additional table lookups)

### Bundle Size
- **Current**: Unknown (should measure before v4)
- **Estimated Additions**:
  - Calendar grid: ~15KB
  - NLP library: ~5KB
  - Focus components: ~10KB
  - Goals/Projects: ~8KB
  - **Total**: ~38KB additional
- **Mitigation**: Code splitting, lazy loading

### Offline-First Compliance
All proposed features work offline except:
- Calendar sync (requires manual file export/import)
- Voice input (Web Speech API requires brief network check)

### Test Coverage Strategy
- Target: Maintain ≥80% coverage
- Priority:
  - High: Natural language parser, time blocking logic, focus sessions
  - Medium: Calendar view, goal tracking
