The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.4] - 2025-10-26 üêõ

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Added validation of Worker push response rejected array
  - MCP server was not checking if Worker rejected operations
  - Only checked HTTP status (200 OK) and conflicts array
  - Worker can reject operations and still return 200 OK with rejected array
  - Now throws detailed error if any operations are rejected
  - **Impact**: v0.4.0-0.4.3 appeared to succeed but tasks were silently rejected

### Technical Details
- Updated `pushToSync()` to parse full `PushResponse` structure
- Added check for `rejected` array in Worker response
- Throws error with detailed rejection reasons (taskId, reason, details)
- Now properly validates that `accepted` array contains the task IDs
- This will surface the actual rejection reason from Worker

## [0.4.3] - 2025-10-26 üêõ

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Added missing checksum calculation for write operations
  - Worker requires SHA-256 checksum of plaintext JSON for create/update operations
  - Added `hash()` method to `CryptoManager` using Web Crypto API
  - Updated all write operations to calculate and include checksum
  - **Impact**: Tasks created without checksum were silently rejected by Worker (appeared successful but not stored)

### Technical Details
- Added `CryptoManager.hash()` method using `webcrypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256')`
- Updated `createTask()` to calculate checksum before push
- Updated `updateTask()` to calculate checksum before push
- Updated `bulkUpdateTasks()` to calculate checksums for all operations
- Checksum is SHA-256 hash of plaintext JSON (before encryption)
- Worker validates checksum on line 125 of `worker/src/handlers/sync.ts`
- Schema says checksum is optional, but Worker code requires it for create/update

## [0.4.2] - 2025-10-26 üêõ

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed JWT payload schema mismatch between MCP server and Worker
  - Changed `user_id` ‚Üí `sub` (JWT standard subject field)
  - Changed `device_id` ‚Üí `deviceId` (camelCase to match Worker)
  - Added `email` and `jti` fields to match Worker's JWT structure
  - Added `getUserIdFromToken()` helper function
  - **Impact**: JWT parsing was failing with "user_id and device_id are missing" error, preventing all operations

### Technical Details
- Updated `jwtPayloadSchema` in `src/jwt.ts` to match `worker/src/utils/jwt.ts`
- Worker generates JWT with standard `sub` field (RFC 7519), not custom `user_id`
- Worker uses camelCase `deviceId`, not snake_case `device_id`
- MCP server now correctly parses tokens from actual Worker OAuth flow

## [0.4.1] - 2025-10-26 üêõ

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed write operations payload structure to match Worker API schema
  - Changed `tasks` array to `operations` array in push requests
  - Changed `vectorClock` to `clientVectorClock` in push payload
  - Added required `type` field to all operations ('create', 'update', 'delete')
  - Changed operation field `id` to `taskId` to match Worker schema
  - Removed `deleted` boolean field in favor of `type: 'delete'`
  - Added per-operation `vectorClock` field (empty object, server-managed)
  - **Impact**: Write operations were 100% non-functional in v0.4.0 due to schema mismatch causing 400 errors from Worker

### Technical Details
- Updated `pushToSync()` function signature to accept `SyncOperation[]` instead of custom task structure
- Added `SyncOperation` interface matching Worker's `syncOperationSchema` (from `worker/src/schemas.ts`)
- Updated all write operation callers:
  - `createTask()` - passes `type: 'create'`
  - `updateTask()` - passes `type: 'update'`
  - `deleteTask()` - passes `type: 'delete'`
  - `bulkUpdateTasks()` - passes appropriate type for each bulk operation
- All operations now conform to Zod schema validation in `pushRequestSchema`
