âœ… New module: `src/crypto.ts` (AES-256-GCM decryption)
âœ… Updated: README.md, DECRYPTION.md, TESTING_V0.2.md

**Build status**: Clean, no errors
**Location**: `/Users/vinnycarpenter/Projects/gsd-taskmanager/packages/mcp-server/dist/`

## What You Need to Do Now

To test the decryption features, follow these 3 steps:

### Step 1: Get Fresh JWT Token
Your current token has expired. Get a new one:

**Option A: Browser DevTools (Fastest)**
1. Open https://gsd.vinny.dev
2. Open DevTools (F12) â†’ Application â†’ Local Storage
3. Find `gsd_auth_token`
4. Copy the value (starts with `eyJ...`)

### Step 2: Find Your Encryption Passphrase
This is what you entered during sync setup.

**To view it**:
1. Open https://gsd.vinny.dev
2. Go to Settings â†’ Sync
3. Look for "Show Passphrase" or similar option

**If you don't remember it**: You can reset it in the app (requires re-syncing all devices)

### Step 3: Update Claude Desktop Config

Edit: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Replace the entire `gsd-tasks` section with this**:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gsd-tasks": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/Users/vinnycarpenter/Projects/gsd-taskmanager/packages/mcp-server/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GSD_API_URL": "https://gsd-sync-worker-production.vscarpenter.workers.dev",
        "GSD_AUTH_TOKEN": "PASTE_YOUR_FRESH_TOKEN_HERE",
        "GSD_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE": "PASTE_YOUR_PASSPHRASE_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**:
- Replace `PASTE_YOUR_FRESH_TOKEN_HERE` with the JWT from Step 1
- Replace `PASTE_YOUR_PASSPHRASE_HERE` with your passphrase from Step 2
- Keep the double quotes around the values

### Step 4: Restart Claude Desktop

1. **Quit** Claude Desktop completely (Cmd+Q)
2. **Reopen** Claude Desktop
3. Wait for it to fully load (~5 seconds)

### Step 5: Test It!

Ask Claude (the user you're talking to now):

**Test 1: List All Tasks**
```
List all my tasks
```

**Expected**: JSON array with decrypted tasks showing titles, descriptions, quadrants, tags, etc.

**Test 2: Search**
```
Search for tasks about [something you know is in your tasks]
```

**Expected**: Matching tasks with full content

**Test 3: Filter**
```
Show me tasks in the Do First quadrant
```

**Expected**: Only urgent + important tasks

## Verification Checklist

Before testing with Claude:

- [ ] Fresh JWT token (from Step 1)
- [ ] Encryption passphrase (from Step 2)
- [ ] Claude Desktop config updated (Step 3)
- [ ] Claude Desktop restarted (Step 4)
- [ ] At least 1 synced task exists in GSD app

## Troubleshooting

### If you get "Invalid or expired token"
- Get a fresh token from the app (tokens expire after 7 days)
- Update config and restart Claude Desktop

### If you get "Encryption passphrase not provided"
- Verify `GSD_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE` is set in config
- Check for typos in the environment variable name
- Restart Claude Desktop after adding it

### If you get "Encryption not set up for this account"
- You haven't completed encryption setup in the GSD app
- Go to Settings â†’ Sync and set up encryption
- Try again after setup completes

### If you get "Decryption failed - passphrase is incorrect"
- Double-check your passphrase (case-sensitive!)
- View/reset passphrase in GSD app Settings â†’ Sync
- Update config with correct passphrase

### If no tasks are returned (no errors)
- Verify you have tasks in the GSD app
- Trigger a manual sync in Settings â†’ Sync
- Wait 30 seconds and try again

## What v0.2.0 Gives You

**New Capabilities**:
- âœ… Ask Claude about your tasks in natural language
- âœ… Search across all task content (titles, descriptions, tags, subtasks)
- âœ… Filter by quadrant, completion status, or tags
- âœ… Get detailed information about specific tasks
- âœ… All while maintaining end-to-end encryption

**Security**:
- ðŸ”’ Passphrase stored only locally (not in cloud)
- ðŸ”’ Server cannot decrypt your tasks
- ðŸ”’ Decryption happens in MCP server on your machine
- ðŸ”’ Read-only access (Claude cannot modify tasks)

## Example Queries

Once configured, try asking Claude:

**Weekly Planning**:
- "What are my urgent tasks this week?"
- "Show me all tasks due before Friday"
- "What's in my Do First quadrant?"

**Task Search**:
- "Find tasks about the quarterly report"
- "Search for tasks mentioning Sarah"
- "Show me all #work tasks"

**Analytics** (when combined with Claude's analysis):
- "How many tasks do I have in each quadrant?"
- "What percentage of my tasks are completed?"
- "Which tags have the most tasks?"

## Documentation

All documentation has been updated for v0.2.0:

- **README.md** - Updated with v0.2.0 features, new tools, security model
- **DECRYPTION.md** - Comprehensive security documentation
- **TESTING_V0.2.md** - Step-by-step testing guide
- **MCP_V0.2_SUMMARY.md** - Implementation summary
- **DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md** - This file

## Next Steps After Testing

Once you've confirmed decryption works:

1. **Try real-world queries** with your actual tasks
2. **Explore use cases** like weekly planning, task discovery
3. **Provide feedback** on what works and what doesn't
4. **Consider future features**:
   - v0.3.0: Write operations (create/update/delete tasks)
   - v0.4.0: Advanced analytics
   - v0.5.0: AI-powered suggestions

## Support
