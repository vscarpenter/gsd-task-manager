# GSD Task Manager — Task Tracker

## Resuming From Here (2026-04-28)

### Just Completed — v9 cleanup (Phases 1, 2, 3) on `claude/infallible-neumann-68a882`
Two commits, one PR:

**Commit 1 (Phases 1+3):** 6 unambiguously dead files removed; `@radix-ui/react-slider` dep dropped; `postcss` 8.5.8 → 8.5.10 + override (CVE GHSA-qx2v-qp2m-jg93 cleared); version 8.7.23 → 8.7.24.

**Commit 2 (Phase 2):** ~30 v8 surface files removed per user's per-cluster decisions. Cluster outcomes:
- Command palette: kept (resurrect later)
- Smart-view 1-9 shortcuts, smart-view UI, bulk multi-select, filter panel, settings modal, user-guide modal + wizard, modular task-form, tag inputs, share-task-dialog, matrix empty/skeleton states: deleted
- Cluster 11 split: `task-timer` and `import-dialog` kept (still wired); `snooze-dropdown`, `task-description`, `reset-everything-dialog` initially flagged dead but **restored after re-verification** — they're imported by `task-card-*.tsx` / `data-management.tsx`. Audit had a transitive-import gap (lazy/nested usage). `keyboard-hints-toast` deleted (truly dead).
- ADR 0011 written; CLAUDE.md updated.
- Version bumped 8.7.24 → 8.8.0 (substantial cleanup).

Verification on Phase 2 commit:
- `bun audit` — 0 vulnerabilities
- `bun typecheck` — clean
- `bun lint` — 5 warnings (1 fewer than baseline; unused-eslint-disable in deleted block)
- `bun run test` — 1773 passed (5 pre-existing edit-drawer failures unrelated; 315 fewer total because dead-code tests removed)
- `bun run build` — static export OK

### Open follow-ups
- [ ] Wire `components/command-palette/` back into `matrix-simplified/app-shell.tsx` (resurrection of cluster 1) — needs a small spec
- [ ] Add `: React.ReactElement` return types to live exported components (~45)
- [ ] Bump `lucide-react` 1.7.0 → 1.12.x — separate PR with visual smoke test
- [ ] Phase 4 (April 22 carryover): unit tests for `lib/sync/pb-{push,pull}.ts`, `lib/tasks/crud/*`, MCP write-handlers
- [ ] Investigate the 5 pre-existing `tests/ui/edit-drawer.test.tsx` timeouts

## Previous: Resuming From Here (2026-04-14)

### Recently Completed
- UX review implementation phases 1-3 (April 2026)
- Pre-launch checklist fixes
- Coding standards alignment updates

### Active Work — Coding Standards Compliance Sprint

Comprehensive audit completed against `coding-standards.md`. 24 issues identified.

**P1 — Critical:**
- [x] Fix 4 failing tests (`localStorage.clear` — replaced with targeted `removeItem` calls + added Storage polyfill in vitest.setup.ts)
- [ ] Add tests for 5 sync module files (background-sync, pb-auth, pb-realtime, pocketbase-client, notifications)
- [ ] Increase lib/db.ts coverage from 28% to 80%

**P2 — High:**
- [ ] Refactor TaskForm (245-line function → focused sub-components)
- [ ] Refactor FilterPanelComponent (272-line function → focused sub-components)
- [x] Replace `window.alert()` with `toast.error()` in smart-view-selector.tsx
- [ ] Write 6 missing ADRs (docs/adr/0004–0009): PWA, MCP, analytics, notifications, BFS algorithm, smart views
- [ ] Add tests for settings components (currently 0% coverage)
- [ ] Add tests for lib/reset-everything.ts (currently 0% coverage)
- [ ] Add tests for command palette (currently 0% coverage)

**P3 — Medium:**
- [ ] Add explicit return types to 15+ exported functions in lib/analytics/*, lib/archive.ts
- [ ] Create .claude/ directory (agent definitions + slash commands)
- [ ] Create root .env.example
- [ ] Document package.json dep rationale in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Increase time-tracking CRUD coverage from 25% to 80%

**P4 — Low:**
- [x] Add `aria-label` to recurrence icon (task-card-actions.tsx:48)
- [ ] Extract magic numbers to named constants in lib/constants.ts
- [ ] Promote April 2026 audit lessons to CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Split multi-concept tests into single-assertion tests
- [ ] Add basic tests for About page + User Guide components

### Blockers
None currently.

### Next Session Starting Point
1. Run `bun run test -- --coverage` to see coverage delta
2. Resume sync module tests (`p1-sync-module-coverage`) — use `vi.mock('pocketbase')` pattern from existing tests
3. Check any outstanding agent results from current sprint
